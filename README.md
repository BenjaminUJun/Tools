# NetIDE Developer Tools

This repository contains projects that will allow network application developers to systematically test, profile, and tune their Network Apps. Some of the tools we are looking to develop are:

1. Logger: tracing capabilities to judge the performance of the deployed Network App
2. Garbage Collector: Reviews infrequently used rules and removes or merges with similar rules.
3. Resource Manager: a mechanism for resource management providing feedback to the Network App and the virtual controller.
4. Model Checker: systematically exercise app behaviour and flag actions that lead to violations of the desired safety properties
5. Profiler: judging the impact of network failures on the Network App behaviour
6. Debugger: supports debug of packet processing (OFReplay, packet inspection and flow table checking)
7. Simulator: used for quick prototyping and performance prediction
