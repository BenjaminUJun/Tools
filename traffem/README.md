# Traffic Emulator

This tool is composed of applications which can be used to generate traffic for the Emulator.

The current applications available are

1. **http**: a client / server application which simulate HTTP traffic from a host to a server. The traffic patterns are similar to what can be found in this work[1].
2. **pcap**: an application which takes .pcap files like those who can be found in .pcap repositories[2][3] or using an external tool like DCTÂ²Gen[4], and create traces playable by a tool like tcpreplay[5].
3. **tftp**: a client / server application which simulate TFTP traffic.
4. **iperfp**: a application which uses _iperf_  to simulate common flow patterns (VoIP, video, ...) in terms of packet size and bandwidth.
